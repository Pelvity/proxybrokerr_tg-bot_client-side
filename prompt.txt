good. 
1. user table should also have columns for last time user message in bot 
2. status (if client is active or is it ex client already)
3. "Clients" button in main menu for admin only that would print out buttons menu with all clients (each button means chat with exact client). after admin choose client than it "opens" chat with exact client (start resending 


also i want to save user payments history but i don't have automatical payment system so im planning so it be like that for now:
1. User get notification about proxy renting end in bot with "Payed" button
2. User make payment manually (for example on binance) and press "Payed"
3. Admin get notification about payment (like "User ... payed for proxy ... rent from date ... to date ....) with "Confirm" button
4. Admin manually check payment and press "Confirm" if everything ok 
5. payment is saved in db



good. now it create tables 
1. one proxy work on one phone (physical). one phone can have one or more phone numbers (my phone numbers and not userPhoneNumbers) related to this phone
i want so db have table for phones and its info:
model, imei, description, date of buying, phone number that is used (foreign key)
and table for sim cart (or create better name): 
phone number, long number on sim cart (forgot name) like id
also i want so all info about connection (include phone and sim cart) was saved in history (so i don't lose data when phone or user of connection changes)
i already have DBProxyHistory, but modify or remake db logics as senior would do. you have all info about topics in which im working


ok, but connection is just way to connect to proxy. what if more than one user gonna use one proxy ? isn't it better to save history based on each connection ?
if not than do what senior would do 



ok, so check my version.
remember that one user can have one or more proxies. each proxy can have zero or more connections (ways to connect). User receive connection info (it don't receive any info about proxy itself). phones and sim cards i told u already. so is logics of db ok ?


in Proxies table i have id (not autoincrement) and authToken that just duplicating proxy id (authToken). how would senior do ? remove id or authToken table 


so would it be better to save just change of connection and when it was made or save current state of connection (all data) and timestamp when it was changed ?


Redundancy: Stores redundant data if some fields don't change often.

but i don't want to save duplicates of connection data. save only if connection data change or if connection was deleted
im not changing my connection data often (only if user changes) so i want so it save all connection data if it was modified
give me full modified code for iproxyService.py firstly (WITHOUT SKIPS):

but how than can i check json data in dbeaver for example ? wouldn't it be easier to save connection data in columns ? Short answer

i want to leave columns without json. how to modify iproyxservice.py and db_models.py ? do i need user_id in connectionHistory if user changes ?
